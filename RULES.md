# Project Rules & Workflows

## AI Interaction Rules
- **Deployment & Remotes**: The AI assistant is **NOT** permitted to run `git push` or modify any remote repositories without explicit verbal permission from the user for each instance.
- **Commits**: The AI can stage and commit changes locally to track progress, but the final push to GitHub (which triggers Vercel deployment) must be authorized by the user.
